The Forgotten Melody

Lena found an old music box in her grandmother’s attic. It was dusty, its key slightly rusted. Curious, she wound it up. A soft, haunting melody filled the room, stirring a distant memory. Suddenly, she saw a faded photograph tucked inside—her grandmother as a young girl with a man Lena didn’t recognize.

That night, she asked her grandmother about it. Tears welled in the old woman’s eyes. “That was my first love,” she whispered. “He gave me the music box before the war took him away.”

Lena played the tune again, letting the forgotten melody live on.
